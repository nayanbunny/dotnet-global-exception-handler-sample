## Description

**Middleware** is software that's assembled into an app pipeline to handle requests and responses. ASP.NET Core provides a rich set of built-in middleware components, but in some scenarios you might want to write a custom middleware.

Each component:

- Chooses whether to pass the request to the next component in the pipeline.
- Can perform work before and after the next component in the pipeline.

<br/>

> **Middleware** is generally encapsulated in a class and exposed with an extension method.

<br/>

The middleware class must include:<br/>

- A public constructor with a parameter of type RequestDelegate.
- A public method named Invoke or InvokeAsync. This method must:
  - Return a Task.
  - Accept a first parameter of type HttpContext.
- Additional parameters for the constructor and Invoke/InvokeAsync are populated by dependency injection (DI).
  Typically, an extension method is created to expose the middleware through IApplicationBuilder.
